monoid
= a monoid is a mathematical structure consist of
1. set of element (carrier set)
2. identity element
3. binary op
4. some propoties

semigroup
= has 3 4 no 2
a semigroup has only an infix function (<>)
that combines two values

law 1: identity
x <> mempty = x (right identity)
mempty <> x = x (left identity)

law 2: associativity
x <> (y <> z) = (x <> y) <> z

type isomorphism
= one-to-one mathematic sets
we can make diffent view of the same type
using newtype

newtype
= keyword warp a type (use record)
